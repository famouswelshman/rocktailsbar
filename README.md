# WEBSITE UX




# WEBSITE FEATURES 
1. Responsive Navbar (Bootstrap)
2. Google Maps API 
3. Opening Times button written via Javascript 'onClick'.
4. 



# WEBSITE STANDARD/ EXISITING FEATURES

#### - __Navigation Bar__
The website features a basic interactive navbar to navigate the site with ease. This navbar which is a product of the Bootstrap code will be present on all pages and will adapt to each resolution by compressing the navbar options content to a dropdown icon when shown on smaller devices. I kept the navbar style as 'light' so it would not clutter the page.

### - __Footer and Social Media Links__
The footer for the website is consistent across all pages and gives the user acces to click on a social media link external to the site and also clickable links within the wesbite.

# FUTURE FEATURES
The future aim of the site is to encourage returning visitors of the page to purchase the band related merchandise such as T-shirts and Logo Stickers. Additional media material will be available for user to view such as videos and downloadable music tracks exclusive to the website.

# TYPOGRAPHY AND COLOUR SCHEME
Since the theme of this website is that of a trendy, live music and drinks venue, I opted for some styles that would reflect and enhance the kind of things offered at the bar venue. Cocktails and tapas traditionally have some association with italic style writing which I used primarily for the links to other pages offering drinks, live music and food pages.
The use of the 'Black Ops One' font for the main title (Rocktails) was inspired by the idea of rock music and it's bold and brash to give the page some edge.

# Google Font 1 (Black Ops One)
Black Ops One for the big titles. The pattern of the cracked letters was attributed to the genre of music being rock hosted at the venue and a little nod to the mish mash of paving out in the garden area.

# Google Font 2 ()
Festive - Gives a theme to the font that connects people to the theme of the bar which is cocktails.


# Google Font 3 ()
Amatic SC - I picked this as a nice subtle font for the use in displaying the location details (bottom left) of the webpage. This font is free flowing and quite subtle and pleasing which is perfect for illustrating the location of the venue and showing opening times etc.


# WIREFRAMES (Balsamic)
I created a mock-up of the website using three visual layouts to cover the responsive nature of the website. 
Balsamic was a real help in enabling me to visualize my web content across each display platform. I did start with the desktop layout rather than start with a handheld layout and this was down to my personal choice! It seems easier to me to create the whole layout and then consolidate this to smaller resolution peripherals so that I could see the whole website idea in front of me first.

I researched websites online so that I could narrow down my use of colours for the design and since my focus was to create an ambient, chilled and artistic vibe I opeted for the subtle use of tungsten which is similar to the lighting at the venue. My vision for this website although fictitious was to give the user an idea and feel for a place just from viewing the website. Returning users would have some affiliation to this colour scheme since the venue would reflect the same colour scheme.

# TESTING CREDITS 



# CODE CREDITS
1. Bootstrap 5 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
Navbar and dropdown toggle button for smaller devices was obtained via Bootstrap 5 website. Bootstrap have a variety of ready made navbar codes which are very user friendly and responsive. I opted for the light toggle navbar which shows links on the top right of page and when consolidated to a smaller resolution or handset will display a toggle button. Very useful and practical, this suited my needs. I also used some Bootstrap column making codes to use within div's on the web pages allowing for responsive result.


2. W3Schools (www.w3schools.com)

3. Dev.to (https://dev.to) - This website is where I obtained some simple JavaScript code to enable a Dark Mode functional button within the content of my website. The code was a simple snippet of Javascript which argumented the change in background color via CSS when interacting via a button.
