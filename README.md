# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

I was interested in creating a made up live music venue based in Ibiza. This was almost me paying homage to a wonderful and colourful place where I spent a lot of time during my youth not only on holidays but in a working capacity. So, I do have a strong affiliation with the live music and bar scene and wanted to create something that captured the fun and happy-go-lucky feel of a music and bar venue that would predominantly cater for the seasonal tourists on their holidays.

The website had to be bold and vibrant with some mellow colours giving it a glow that is very familiar to the music scene and complimented the stylish theme of it being a cocktail bar which also served classy food and wasnt just your run of the mill touristy, UK audience driven venue for holiday punters and their families!!!

I wanted to create a website that could would almost spoon feed its users what exactly the venue offers and where to see it.

*Please note* - This bar and its contents are purely fictitious and not actively trading or operating as a business. The name and it's contents are purely for the purpose of showcasing a website idea. The currency and the costs of anything in this website are merely for display purpose and are not factually accurate. The name 'Rocktails' is also a made up name and is not licenced or owned by anyone causing any copyright issues. This website was constructed purely as a project for my 2nd Milestone and does not operate as anything else.


# USER STORIES

# User story 1
![User story 1](https://github.com/famouswelshman/rocktailsbar/blob/main/wireframes/user_story_1.jpg "User story 1")
The user will be presented with a home page which displays a nice warm background picture and text. With the navbar floating on the page, this makes it easy for the user to navigate content. 
Home page shows the main links to all the content making choice easy for the user so for instance if they had visited to find out about the live music, the link is bold and obvious making it easier for the user to steer directly towards the content they are looking for. The home page also focuses on the location of the venue utilising a map which makes it visually more appealing and details of the venue opening times making this content more beneficial to the site visitors since this website is built to promote an actual venue where people would visit.

# User story 2
![User story 2](https://github.com/famouswelshman/rocktailsbar/blob/main/wireframes/user_story_2.jpg "User story 2")
If you visit the website looking for information on the live music which takes place at the venue then the link to live music is bold and easily located. This takes the user to a similar themed page which displays a music themed background picture and shows a short blurb on the history of the venue and the music it hosts. This page would need further development and has been kept basic to simply showcase the page layout for this website. Additional 'Book Now' function might be appropriate for future development which has link to a booking form.

# User story 3
![User story 2](https://github.com/famouswelshman/rocktailsbar/blob/main/wireframes/user_story_3.jpg "User story 2")
User visiting the website looking for food and drinks information will easily find a link on the home page which directs user to a nice glossy bakground shot and some foody images and the availability of the menus below which conveniently open as seperate pdf documents independant of the website. The menus are bright and offer a wealth of detail for the potential customer looking to either visit the venue, make enquiries or book to eat there.

# User story 4
![User story 2](https://github.com/famouswelshman/rocktailsbar/blob/main/wireframes/user_story_4.jpg "User story 2")
If the user has successfully navigated the website and found what they were looking for and wanted to make an enquiry, they can find a link in either the navbar or the footer to link them to a dedicated contact form page. This page uses the Javascript function to enable the customer to add their details and any message which is easily sent by a button click. The enquiry is also followed up with confirmation of their email by sending a message to their preferred inbox as stated in the contact form at they time they completed this.


# WEBSITE UX

Idea for a 3 page website that gave user quick navigation of it's content and focused on showcasing it's main functions - Food & drinks and live music.

Index Page – Bar picture for hero pic with scroll down to menu, live music and cocktails.
The index page includes map API at the bottom to show location of the venue.

Live Music Page – Music background picture with a paragraph on what goes on at the venue regarding music and events.

Tapas & burgers Page – Menu style breakdown of the Tapas and Burgers foods available at the venue. PDF pop out of the menu if possible.

Contact via contact link in the navbar would scroll to the bottom of the page to show the contact details and social media links.



# WEBSITE FEATURES 
1. Responsive Navbar (Bootstrap)
Bootstrap have a library of pre-built navbars which are suited to website building making it easy and profesional for use in your project. I chose to use the navbar light which is of a light colour to compliment my colour theme and reverts to a dropdown when the media size is reduced enabling user to easily navigate the website on smaller devices.

2. Google Maps API 
The API used in this website is the 'Google Maps' API. It's purpose for the website is to show with visual ease the exact location of the venue. The additional function of this API is that it is interactive and allows the user to zoom in and zoom out giving further depth to the viewing of the map. The map is most beneficial to the user when finding the venue location in respect of their current location which might be close to the venue but they require more accurate detail. 

3. Opening Times button written via Javascript 'onClick'.
The opening times can be found at the bottom of the home page. There is a Javascript function in place that upon click, reveals additional information about the opening hours. This feature is of benefit to smaller devices where the function allows the reveal and hide of this information allowing room for more content on the handset. This function also demonstrated the use of Javascript which is for the purpose of this Milestone.

4. Popup Food menu.
The two menus being used on the website show as jpeg images but where the user is prompted to click on these, they would open in a pdf format independant of the website allowing the user to view this content in more detail and at the same time, not be taken away from the website.

5. Contact Form
The contact form code is a product of a website called EmailJS. They provide the code for a email based service function which allows captured data to be sent to a commercial or personal email address. This feature allows the user to complete several basic text based fields which was created by myself and a button to send the information to the email address registered with EmailJS.


# WEBSITE STANDARD/ EXISITING FEATURES

### - __Navigation Bar__
The website features a basic interactive navbar to navigate the site with ease. This navbar which is a product of the Bootstrap code will be present on all pages and will adapt to each resolution by compressing the navbar options content to a dropdown icon when shown on smaller devices. I kept the navbar style as 'light' so it would not clutter the page.

### - __Footer and Social Media Links__
The footer for the website is consistent across all pages and gives the user access to click on a social media links that open external to the main website.

### - __Responsive across multiple media__
The website was constructed and tested to accomodate a cross platform of media sizes. The enabling of responsivity was based on media queries added to the main CSS file. The importance here is that the content and it's funcionality is consistent across most or all media, making it easy for the user to navigate and view the content with ease.


# FUTURE FEATURES
The future aim of the site is to attract new customers to a trendy, live music venue whilst they are on holiday and near the venue. Similar to brands such as Pacha and SPACE, the aim of the website was to also sell merchandise and offer access to events. Build upon the brand of 'Cocktails' and market it as 'the top live music venue in Ibiza' and compete with similar venues!

# TYPOGRAPHY AND COLOUR SCHEME
Since the theme of this website is that of a trendy, live music and drinks venue, I opted for some styles that would reflect and enhance the kind of things offered at the bar venue. Cocktails and tapas traditionally have some association with italic style writing which I used primarily for the links to other pages offering drinks, live music and food pages.
The use of the 'Black Ops One' font for the main title (Rocktails) was inspired by the idea of rock music and it's bold and brash to give the page some edge.

# Google Font 1 (Black Ops One)
Black Ops One for the big titles. The pattern of the cracked letters was attributed to the genre of music being rock hosted at the venue and a little nod to the mish mash of paving out in the garden area.

# Google Font 2 (Festive)
Festive - Gives a theme to the font that connects people to the theme of the bar which is cocktails.


# Google Font 3 (Amatic SC)
Amatic SC - I picked this as a nice subtle font for the use in displaying the location details (bottom left) of the webpage. This font is free flowing and quite subtle and pleasing which is perfect for illustrating the location of the venue and showing opening times etc.


# Milestone 2 Project --- WIREFRAMES ---- Using Balsamic
I created a mock-up of the website using three visual layouts to cover the responsive nature of the website. Standard desktop and Laptop layout was used for larger resolution based screens, standard tablet template and mobiel handset template were used for the smaller resolution screen items.

Balsamic was a real help in enabling me to visualize my web content across each display platform. I started design of the website by focusing on the desktop layout rather than start with a smaller resolution handheld layout and this was down to my personal choice! It seems easier to me to create the whole layout on a larger screen and and then consolidate the content to smaller resolution peripherals. Doing it this way meant I could see the whole website idea in front of me in full and it was important to see how the Javascript based functions responded to load times and functioned upon load up.

I researched similar themed websites online so that I could narrow down my use of colours for the design and since my focus was to create an ambient, chilled and artistic vibe I opeted for the subtle use of tungsten which is similar to the lighting at the venue. My vision for this website although fictitious was to give the user an idea and feel for a place just from viewing the website. Returning users would have some affiliation to this colour scheme since the venue would reflect the same colour scheme.

My vision for the design of this site was to keep each page consistent with a background image (hero) image with large, bold text to scroll over it when going down the page. The consistent theme is evident throughout the website, making use of the box style links and ensuring the footer and its social-links remained similar across the site. The important thing was to try and keep this website from being too busy, allowing larger text to show through and not be challenged by the background pictures. Content kept to a minimum and allowing the user to view menu image before clicking to open them outside the website.

# VALIDATION OF CODE
1. Code Validation (W3C Markup Validation Service)


2. css validation (W3C CSS validator)


3. Javascript validation (Jshint)


4. Supported screens 


# DEPLOYMENT
1. Via Github using Vs Code (Desktop files linked to GitHub and commits actioned locally)

2. Google Map API - The placement of an API in the web content required a key by registering with Google API's. This key is specific to myself as a registered customer allowing me to host the API on the website.
Each application would require a dedicated key in order for the API to work correctly within the website.

2. Via Github pages

# TESTING

1. Bugs
When the website was loaded in GitHub I realised that the Javascript written was not functioning within the website. The reason for this was that the path file for the external JS file was entered into the index page as absolute and not relative causing the Javascript not to load. This was a clear error on my part and was quickly realised. It seemed that the link to the CSS file was correct (relative) and therefore worked correctly.


2. Responsive Challenges
Making this website responsive was a challenge. I ran the website using VS Code live server to reflect any changes and my biggest challenge was making the whole thing responsive for multiple screens. The google map API was coded inside of a section div and the purpose of this was to collapse the div when it reached a smaller resolution allowing the opening times section to be stacked above the Google Map display. I adjusted the size for both divs since they sat side by side but without success. 

3. Javascript Code execution
The Javascript script tags were included in the html pages at the bottom of each page in order for the code to execute upon the load of the html. Based on the simplification of the code included I decided that for load times it would be better to include the script links at the bottom of the page and within the <body> tags.

4. Loading speeds
I had to ensure that the website would load fairly quickly which was a challenge given the inclusion of Javascript which was added according to the DOM to run following the HTML. Since the Google Map API is hosted via a API server supplier the function loaded reasonably quick upon opening the index page. 

5. Media Content
My greatest challenge was to ensure that the images and background images would be reasonably quick at loading. Through testing with various picture formats it seemed that the lower the resolution the file, the quicker it would load therefore not to compromise on quality I saved the final images to the JPEG format which was around 80% less in file size compared to PNG which is what I had originally used.

6. Contact form fields content required. In order for the form to be succesfully completed with the correct date, I had to ensure that the code tag (required) was added to each field. This way, any field which was due completion of data sent a visual prompt to the user if the field was not completed before the submition of the form upon clicking the button.

7. Javascript image animation. This simple code was used in order to have a timed change of images. More specifically for the banner which is within the html code on the Live music page. This simple rotation enabled the timed change between two images therefore presenting an animation on the page between images. 

8. API (Google Map) - The challenge for testing this facility was ensuring the asset key was included in html in order for the API to show. I carefully revised the crednetials with this API to ensure it would be fully functioning across all platforms and not just restricted to web browsers or a certain operating system such as Android. Asset key for this API was generated following the registration with a credit card number allowing its use on a free but limited basis.

# OVERALL SUMMARY OF TESTING AND SUCCESFUL USABILITY

The website operates quickly but minor issues still remain on lower resolution handsets which is down to the time spent on further testing and deployment. 
Navbar via Bootstrap is fully functional and the navbar collapses when the screen size is reduced giving the user the ability to select any page link and the dropdown pushes the content down the page without obscuring the content.
Opening times code works upon click, although this function is basic it shows how Javascript can manipulate actions upon click function. The task here was to ensure the opening times content box was not obscuring the rest of the page before clicking and allowing the opening times date to open and push the content down below it.

Contact form is simple and user friendly with perfect functionality. Fields allow the entering of basic text information before a click of the submit button send the information to a personal email and Javascript prompts a pop-up box to show on screen to suggest the contact from content has been sent.

# TESTING CREDITS 



# CODE CREDITS
1. Bootstrap 5 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
Navbar and dropdown toggle button for smaller devices was obtained via Bootstrap 5 website. Bootstrap have a variety of ready made navbar codes which are very user friendly and responsive. I opted for the light toggle navbar which shows links on the top right of page and when consolidated to a smaller resolution or handset will display a toggle button. Very useful and practical, this suited my needs. I also used some Bootstrap column making codes to use within div's on the web pages allowing for responsive result.


2. W3Schools (www.w3schools.com)
This website offered me ideas for using Javascript within my website and therefore I created my own JS script for the functionality of the 'Opening Times' button situated on the index page which upon 'onClick' will reveal the neccessary information. A simple, quick function but effective as a form of interactivity. I wanted to credit this website for it's ideas and learning content.

3. Dev.to (https://dev.to) - This website is where I obtained some simple JavaScript code to enable a Dark Mode functional button within the content of my website. The code was a simple snippet of Javascript which argumented the change in background color via CSS when interacting via a button.
